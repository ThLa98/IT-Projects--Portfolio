# Small Office Network Design & Deployment Project  

This project was completed as part of my Certificate III in ICT Networking. It demonstrates the design, configuration, testing, and documentation of a small office LAN for a simulated client (Red Opal Innovations).  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies  
- Router (RV215W) & Switch  
- Windows 10  
- TCP/IP, DHCP, HTTP  
- WPA2 Encryption, Windows Firewall  
- Troubleshooting tools: `ping`, `ipconfig`, `tracert`, speed test  

## ðŸ“Œ Key Tasks  
- Gathered and documented client requirements for a new branch office network  
- Designed LAN topology with desktops, laptops, printer, and router  
- Configured router, switch, and devices for connectivity and security  
- Implemented firewall, password policies, and WPA2 encryption  
- Developed maintenance schedule for hardware and printer  
- Conducted connectivity and performance testing (ping, traceroute, ipconfig, speed test)  
- Delivered printer setup and maintenance  

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated  
- LAN design and deployment  
- Device configuration and troubleshooting  
- Security implementation (firewall, passwords, WPA2)  
- Network testing and validation  
- IT documentation  
- Client handover and sign-off  

## âœ… Outcome  
Successfully designed and deployed a functioning small office network with secure connectivity, maintenance procedures, and end-user training. The project was documented and approved with client sign-off.
